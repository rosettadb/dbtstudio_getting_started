# 🎓 DBTStudio - Getting Started Sample Project

Welcome to the **Getting Started** project for [**DBTStudio**]([https://github.com/your-org/dbtstudio](https://github.com/rosettadb/dbt-studio)) — a visual interface for **dbt-core** powered by the magic of [**RosettaDB**](https://github.com/AdaptiveScale/rosetta)!

This sample project provides you with a lightweight, ready-to-use **DuckDB** database to kick off your data modeling journey. It's designed to help you explore DBTStudio’s capabilities for generating **staging**, **enhanced**, and **business** layer dbt models with a few simple clicks.

## 🚀 What You’ll Get With DBTStudio

- ✅ A pre-built **DuckDB** sample database with real-world academic data structures
- ✅ Auto-generated **staging**, **enhanced**, and **business** models via **RosettaDB**
- ✅ One-click execution of **dbt-core** commands directly from the UI
- ✅ A perfect playground to understand how DBTStudio speeds up your analytics workflow
